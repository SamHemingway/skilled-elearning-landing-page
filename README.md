## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Saas

### What I learned

- Making multiple image sources work using `<picture>` is a complete pain in the arse. I managed to get it working (with images for 2x pixel density and webp/png), only to realise that there wasnt really a way to make it work as a background image which felt more appropriate for the content... which meant I scrapped it anyways. Good to learn though!
- Sass is cool. Creating a function for linear interpolation was very satisfying.

### Continued development

- There has to be a way to achieve this kind of design without the use of media queries... but I'm not there yet.

### Useful resources

- [Saas Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - A constant open tab whilst learning how to use Saas.
- [Saas Tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs) - Excellent video that got the ball rolling for me.
